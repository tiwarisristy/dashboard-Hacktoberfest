## About This Project

This project is a dashboard designed for display on a public screen, such as a TV in an office. Its purpose is to provide a real-time, at-a-glance overview of key project metrics for the team. The goal is to make critical information easily accessible and to promote a shared understanding of team progress.

## Roadmap

Below is a list of features planned for future updates to the dashboard:
- [ ] Implement a real-time data connection.
- [ ] Add a visual chart for project progress (e.g., a progress bar or pie chart).
- [ ] Display key performance indicators (KPIs), such as remaining tasks or active contributors.
- [ ] Add a dark mode for better visibility under different lighting conditions.

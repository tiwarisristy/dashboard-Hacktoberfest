## About This Project

This project is a dashboard designed for display on a public screen, such as a TV in an office. Its purpose is to provide a real-time, at-a-glance overview of key project metrics for the team. The goal is to make critical information easily accessible and to promote a shared understanding of our progress.

## Roadmap

This is a list of features we plan to add to the dashboard in the future:
- [ ] Implement a real-time data connection.
- [ ] Add a visual chart for project progress (e.g., a progress bar or pie chart).
- [ ] Display key performance indicators (KPIs) like remaining tasks or active contributors.
- [ ] Add a dark mode for better visibility in different lighting conditions.
